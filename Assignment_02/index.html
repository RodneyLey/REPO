            <h3 class="breadType">Baguette</h3>
            <p>Baguettes first became popular in the late 18th century, and by 1920, it was officially given the name ‘baguette’. The baguette became so popular that bakers started to look for shortcuts, and were using pre-made, frozen dough to speed up the baking process.In 1993, Le Décret Pain (‘The Bead Decree’) was passed in an attempt to keep the authenticity of the baguette. It enshrined in law that an authentic baguette must be made by hand, sold in the same bakery in which it’s made, and only made from water, wheat flour, yeast and salt.

            <h3 class="breadType">French country bread</h3>
            <p>Also known as Pain de Campagne, is a traditional French bread that’s hearty and rustic. It’s made with a sourdough starter, giving it a slightly tangy flavour that works perfectly with meat and cheese. This type of bread tends to be chewier than a baguette, and it can come in a variety of different shapes – although all varieties tend to be irregular, which sets this bread apart from the uniform appearance of the baguette. </p>

            <h3 class="breadType">Crown Bread</h3>
            <p>It’s a round bread with a hole in the middle, resembling a crown or a ring. The centre hole is made by joining the two ends of the dough circle, creating a crown-like shape. The basic ingredients for pain couronne are similar to those of other traditional French breads, including flour, water, yeast (or sourdough starter) and salt – but there are lots of ways to put your own spin on it. Some recipes call for a little olive oil in the dough for added flavour, while others use olives, herbs, cheese or seeds. You can even get sweet pain couronne, with added sugar, honey, spices or dried fruits.</p>
